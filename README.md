# Math Snake Game

## Project Overview
The **Math Snake Game** is an educational project aimed at helping school children improve their arithmetic skills through engaging gameplay. The game combines math problems with classic snake game mechanics to make learning fun.

Players answer math questions by controlling the snake to collect blocks with the correct answers. The game features two modes: 
1. **Mode 1**: Solve problems at varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
2. **Mode 2**: A timed challenge where players must reach a target sum.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Players can create an account, log in, and track progress.
- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy (single-digit numbers), Medium (two-digit numbers), and Hard (three-digit numbers).
- **Mode 2**: Timed gameplay where players need to reach a target number within two minutes.
- **Flask and Pygame Integration**: Uses Flask for the web interface and `pygame` for the core gameplay mechanics.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: For the web backend and handling user registration and login.
- **Pygame**: For snake movement and game interactions.
- **MySQL**: Used for storing user data and managing logins.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend interface for user interaction.
